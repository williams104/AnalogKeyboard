Documentation of my research to figure how to make a hall effect keyboard.
The Wooting 60HE is out of stock, so I decided to make my own.
I plan for this to be the keyboard I will use, so I hope to make it on par with the fastest hall effect keyboards./
This will mean researching hall sensors and potentially reverse engineering Wooting and other hall effect / rapid trigger keyboards to see what makes them so fast.
